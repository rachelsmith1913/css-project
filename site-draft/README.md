# Site Draft Project

**Due:** Friday, April 17, Noon.


## Instructions

This assignment is worth **10 points**.

You are to begin creating the foundation for your final project.

## Before you begin

Please read the [final-project](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/final-project) rubric to understand what is expected for that project. Keep it in mind as you build your draft.


## Requirements

Your submission **must** include:

- sketches of your design ideas. These do not need to be exact mockups. Please take photos of the designs and include them in a `sketches` directory in your `username.github.io` repository. You do not need to make these appear on your site; they are for reference only.

- organized site architecture (css files in `css` directory; images in an `image` directory, etc.).

- an `index.html` page. This can be a landing page or a page which gets right into your content. (You will overwrite the existing `index.html` page in your repository. See below.)

- all pages marked up in proper, valid HTML.

- effective site navigation on all pages.

- properly formatted and sized web images.

- basic CSS. You must have a color scheme and web fonts displayed on your page. Starting your layout is suggested -- because we can de-bug issues early -- but not essential.

- No broken images.

- No broken links.

NOTE: You may complete more than is listed here, but these are the minimum requirements to earn credit on this project. I *do not* expect to see the finished product, nor do I want to! You will receive feedback which you are expected to implement for the final. Failure to apply the corrections will result in a deduction on the final!


### Reminder

When including images:

- you must have the rights to use it
- it must be included in your GitHub repo (no linking to an image or file hosted on another site)


## Submission

The number of files to be submitted may vary. Include any images of your layout ideas in a `sketches` directory. You will have at least three html files, including `index.html`. A stylesheet and any images must be organized with a proper site architecture. These should be in the *root* of your `username.github.io` repository on GitHub. **DO NOT** store these files within another folder within your repository.

Commit your files to the `username.github.io` repo you created at the beginning of the semester.

[Create an issue](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/css-project/issues) in the `css-project` repository with your full name and a link to your web page (`http://username.github.io/index.html`) by the deadline. If you are unsure of how to submit, check the example provided in the Issues section.

Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.


## Grading

You are expected to do your best to meet the requirements listed above. If you give an *honest effort* and submit the work on time, you will receive full credit. Your professor reserves the right to deduct points for submissions perceived as rushed, insufficient or incomplete.

To assure you do not make mistakes going forward, you will receive feedback. One-on-one help is  available via office hour appointments to go over any questions you may have to improve the quality of your work moving forward. Missing requirements and/or mistakes on future assignments will not be overlooked.

**You are required to submit this assignment properly and on time.** A missed deadline (submitting the assignment at 12:00:01 p.m.) will result in a three (3) point deduction for every 24-hour period the assignment is late up to three days past deadline.

**Any extensions for extenuating circumstances must be cleared BEFORE the deadline.** No extensions will be granted after the deadline has passed.

Failure to submit the assignment to GitHub as detailed above (to your `username.github.io` repo, as `index.html`) will result in a two (2) point deduction.

(I use a computer script to clone and do an initial validation check of every student's work. If the script breaks, it means I have to do extra work to find and/or grade your assignment. Therefore, it will cost you in points.)

**Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.**


### FAQ

**Do I need to keep all the files from old projects in `username.github.io`?**

No. Feel free to delete old files. If you opt to leave the old files (i.e. `index.html`, `resume.html`, `style.css`, etc.) just be aware that you'll be overwriting them (which is fine; GitHub has all the old versions of your work stored in past commits).

**Can I use my resume created for the first project in my final?**

Yes, but it cannot just be a cut-and-paste addition. You will likely need to make adjustments to have it fit in with the design you are creating for your overall site. You may need to adjust HTML, CSS, content, etc. to make it work.

**Can I do a one-column layout?**

Yes, but you *MUST* use a technique to move elements outside the normal flow on the page.

**Must my design be flexible?**

This is not a requirement. Try using pixels/fixed widths to lay out the page, then adjust your CSS to change it to become flexible (i.e. using `min-width`, `max-width`, fractional units). Some designs will flex with ease; others won't. If it flexes, keep it! If it doesn't, change your code to use the fixed approach.

**Does my (max) 960-pixel container have to be centered?**

If you have a left-aligned design (i.e. a left column with a background which features prominently on the right), you do not need to center the container. It goes against the design you're aiming for. (Unless, of course, you find a creative way to have that background stretch all the way to the left side of the browser window!) Otherwise, yes.

**Good luck!**
