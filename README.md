# README

**DUE: Friday, April 17, Noon.**

**Any extensions for extenuating circumstances must be cleared BEFORE the deadline.** No extensions will be granted after the deadline has passed.

In order to allow adequate time to prepare for the final project, I am giving the option of submitting a side draft in lieu of the CSS project. There is no penalty for submitting one or the other.

Please read both rubrics and consider which may be best for you for getting practice and feedback on the course material.
